# Currency Converter App Specification

This multiplatform Kotlin app allows users to select two currencies from a list of supported currencies. It then calculates and displays the converted amount based on the selected currencies and the entered amount. The app fetches current exchange rates from [currencylayer](https://currencylayer.com/) API, ensuring accurate conversions.
